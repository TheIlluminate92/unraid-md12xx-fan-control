# License and redistribution

The project's original code and documentation are available under the [MIT License](LICENSE). You may use, modify and redistribute them, including commercially, while retaining the copyright and permission notice. The software is provided **as is**, without warranty; the full license contains the liability disclaimer.

Third-party code, dependencies, bundled assets and their notices retain their respective terms. This license grants no rights to third-party names, logos, trademarks, proprietary data or external services. Preserve applicable upstream notices when redistributing. It does not promise certification, fitness for a particular use or exemption from applicable law.

## Packaging and verification

The plugin source payload includes LICENSE beside the existing ipmitool, musl and OpenSSL notices. The next normal build carries it into the installed plugin directory. Existing rolling installers and immutable releases were not rebuilt by this source change.

For Python builds, collected distribution notices are a conservative build-environment inventory, not a complete legal clearance. Review missing notices and vendored/native libraries before publishing. Previously embedded notices must remain intact. For other packaging, preserve the existing upstream notices and copy the project LICENSE with the distributed software.

## Maintainer record — 2026-11-13

The owner authorized permissive reuse with the standard MIT warranty and liability disclaimer. Source licensing and future packaging were updated; no live application, hardware or plant acceptance is implied. Release maintainers own the next corrected package and its archive checks. Existing releases remain dated evidence. Reverting packaging code does not revoke MIT permissions already granted.
